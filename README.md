CRUD Operations in Java - Spring Boot

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Java Spring Boot. It demonstrates how to implement basic API endpoints for managing student data using a service layer and a custom in-memory repository.

✔ Features Implemented

GET – Fetch all students

POST – Add a new student

DELETE – Remove a student by ID

Custom In-Memory Repository using ArrayList

Service Layer to handle business logic

Controller Layer exposing REST APIs

Spring Boot application running on port 8080

✔ Technologies Used

Java

Spring Boot

Spring Web

IntelliJ IDEA

Git / GitHub

✔ Project Flow

Controller → Service → Repository → In-Memory Data Storage

Each request prints logs to the console, showing the flow of execution (controller running…, repo running…, etc.), making the logic easy to understand for beginners.
